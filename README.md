Church encoding ADT

This project is a way of going deeper into lambda calculus, and functional programming paradigm itself.

The implementation is based in the following article: http://programmable.computer/posts/church_encoding.html
Thanks to its author.


My wishes are going into:

- Free monads
- Stack safe solution
- Evaluate lazy aproximations
- Preparing some talk and going around to show it :-)
